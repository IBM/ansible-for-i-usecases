  - name: Default passwords provide an opportunity for someone to enter your system,
          if someone knows your policy for assigning profile names and knows that a new person is joining
          your organization. Additionally, accounts with default passwords are often used
          for shared (non- unique) accounts. Tell the new user the password confidentially, such as
          in a "Welcome to the System" letter that outlines your security policies. Require the user to change
          the password the first time that the user signs on by setting the user profile to PWDEXP(*YES)
